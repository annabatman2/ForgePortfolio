            <p>
                Anna is a third year computer science student at the University
                of Virginia and plans to build a career in software engineering
                upon graduation. She is also passionate about volunteering and
                has completed over 100 service hours through volunteer trips in
                Cambodia and Brazil, where she provided education to children
                living in underprivileged areas. Her goal is to combine her love
                of volunteering and passion for problem solving through
                software; she plans to do this by working with non-profits to
                make tangible differences in her community. Whether she
                contributes to educational, environmental, health or social
                initiatives, Anna is excited to be an impactful developer whose
                passion is visible in the lives of others. Outside of class,
                Anna enjoys listening to her extensive vinyl collection and
                visiting local record stores; some of her favorite artists
                include Neil Young, The Charlie Parker Quartet and The Cure.
